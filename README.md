# SQL & Databases
Project Overview:
This final-year group project involved designing and interacting with a relational database using Oracle Database and SQL. Our aim was to build a well-structured database schema based on a realistic scenario and perform various SQL operations to manage and retrieve data effectively.

Objectives:
To apply relational database design principles in creating tables and defining relationships
To implement data integrity using constraints such as primary keys and foreign keys
To develop and execute SQL queries for inserting, updating, deleting, and retrieving data
To write advanced queries involving joins, subqueries, and aggregate functions
To gain practical experience working within the Oracle SQL environment

Project Scope:
Designing a relational database schema relevant to a chosen domain (e.g., business management, education)
Populating the database with sample data for testing
Executing and documenting a range of SQL queries to demonstrate CRUD operations and complex data retrieval
Providing clear documentation of the database structure and the logic behind key queries

Repository Contents:
SQL scripts for creating tables and inserting data
Query files showcasing different SQL commands and techniques
Documentation explaining database design choices and query purposes

This project enhanced our understanding of database systems and improved our ability to work with Oracle SQL in a practical, real-world setting.
